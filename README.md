## Installation

To get started with photon install it from PyPi*.

```bash
pip install photon
```

<p style="color:#a2a2a2;">*As we are still in development, we haven't uploaded this project to PyPi, expected release for PyPi is planned for 21 jan 2026</p>

## Project Setup & CLI

We have cli for automatic template implementation for your project. We have added multiple commands to this for faster and safer implementation of photon into your own app.

## Installation

Install Photon from PyPI (when available) or install from source during development:

```bash
pip install photon
```

_Note: Photon is under active development; the first PyPI release is planned for January 21, 2026._

## Quick Start

A minimal workflow to create and run a new project:

```bash
# create a new project skeleton
photon createproject blog_project ./

# inside your project, create a new app using manage.py
python manage.py createapp myapp

# run the development server
python manage.py runserver
```

## Project Setup & CLI

Photon provides a small CLI to scaffold projects and apps. Below are the most-used commands:

- `photon createproject <name> <directory>` — Creates a new project skeleton.
- `python manage.py createapp <appname>` — Adds an app into an existing project.
- `python manage.py runserver` — Runs the development server on localhost.

Common flags for `createapp`:

- `--router` — Initialize an app router and register its routes with the main router.
- `--static-app` — Create an app preconfigured for serving static assets or static-only tasks.

## Base Project Structure

This is the base layout generated by the Photon CLI:

```text
blog_project/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ __init__.py
│  └─ testapp/
│     ├─ router.py
│     ├─ views.py
│     └─ models.py
├─ main.py
├─ view.py
├─ manager.py
├─ router.py
└─ photon_config.py
```

- `apps/`: application packages — each app typically contains `router.py`, `views.py`, and `models.py`.
- `main.py`: application entry point that composes the app and starts the server.
- `manager.py`: project management CLI (used for `createapp`, `runserver`, etc.).
- `photon_config.py`: central configuration for Photon-powered projects.

## Contributing

Contributions and bug reports are welcome. Please open issues or pull requests in the project repository and follow the contribution guidelines.

If you'd like, I can also:
- add a short example `photon_config.py` template,
- include a sample `manage.py` snippet showing the CLI entrypoint.
Tell me which you'd prefer next.

There are many ways to setup routing in photon for the main project as well as the current app. 

1. **Project Level Routing -**
    You can setup routing for the whole project in `router.py` file located in the main project directory.

    Example:

    ```python
    from photon import Router
    from apps.testapp.router import router as testapp_router

    main_router = Router()

    main_router.include_router(testapp_router) # You can also directly specify prefix here as well.
    ```

2. **App Level Routing -**
    Each app can have its own router file to manage its routes separately. This is done in `router.py` file inside the app directory.

    Example:
    ```python
    from photon import Route, Router
    from photon.tests import test_view

    router = Router(prefix="/testapp") # You can also specify this prefix in main router while including.

    router[
        Route.get("/hello", test_view.test, name="hello_world")
    ].setup()
    ```

## Routes in Photon

You can create routes with every method type with `Route` class from photon.

Example:
```python
Route.get("/path", view_function, name="route_name")
Route.post("/path", view_function, name="route_name")
Route.put("/path", view_function, name="route_name")
Route.delete("/path", view_function, name="route_name")

# Many allowed methods

Route.options("/path", view_function, name="route_name")
```
